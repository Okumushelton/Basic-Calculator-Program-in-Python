# Basic-Calculator-Program-in-Python

## ðŸ“‹ Description
Beginner-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations â€” **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (%)** â€” on two numbers provided by the user.

The calculator ensures that:
- The user enters **valid numeric inputs**.
- The user selects a **valid operation** from the allowed list.
- It **prevents division/modulus by zero** and handles such cases gracefully.


## Features

- Accepts user input for two numbers
- Performs one of the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
- Displays the result of the operation
- Prompts again if the user enters an invalid operation
- Protects against division or modulus by zero
